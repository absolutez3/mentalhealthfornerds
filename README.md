# mentalhealthfornerds
An open project meant to benefits those with mental illness.

What this guide is supposed to do: 

This guide is meant to recommend supplements that have been found to ease some of the symptoms of mental illness. None of these are a cure. This is not meant to replace therapists, psychiatrists, or medications. While there are supplements others swear by, initially I will only include those that have multiple studies where at least two are double-blind and placebo controlled. This limits the amount but I feel it to be necessary. 


## Anxiety Supplements:

###  Kava:
  Dosage: 300mg daily taking ~100mg three times daily. 300mg at once may act as a sedative.
  Effects: Multiple studies show significant improvement in anxiety levels over a period of weeks. The anxiolytic (anxiety reducing) effects are even on par with benzodiazepines like Xanax. Some studies also note an increase in subjective well being.

## # L-Theanine:
